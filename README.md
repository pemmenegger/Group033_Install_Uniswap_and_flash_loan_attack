# Project Description
The goal is to be able to implement decentralized exchanges such as Uniswap in our university network and to use it with contracts to perform certain specialized actions. We are trying to understand what a flash loan attack is in code, how to implement it successfully in contracts, and use chain-link price feeds to see how much can be taken and that it is taken by the flash loan attack. 

# Approach
1. Deploy Uniswap
2. Deploy sample tokens and add liquidity to its pairs via uniswap contracts
3. Deploy Flash Loan contracts
4. Deploy sample token and transfer the whole amount to the flash loan lending contract.
