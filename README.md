# Project Description
The goal is too able to implement decentralized exchanges such as Uniswap in our university network and to use it with contracts to perform certain specialized actions. We are trying to understand what a flash loan attack is in code, how to implement it successfully in contracts, and use chain-link price feeds to see how much can be taken and that it is taken by the flash loan attack.
